GSOC-25-Traffic_Intersection_Monitoring with OpenVino

This system leverages YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 deep learning models for accurate detection and classification of traffic-related objects. 
Week 1 establishes the core detection pipeline and evaluates performance across model variants.
1.Integrated YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models for detection
2.Created class mapping from COCO â†’ traffic-specific labels
3.Size, shape, and distance-aware vehicle classification
4.Built image processing pipeline
5.A temporal tracking module is under development to improve detection stability over video frames.
6.Doing advanced processing for Off-road object filtering,Overlapping box elimination.
